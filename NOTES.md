Q) why to learn react?

ans) to build complex UI/frontEnd.

### NOTE - 
- at the end , react will get compiled to HTML,CSS and JS only.

- browser can only understand HTML,CSS and JS.

Q) why react was created?

- to solve ghost message problem.
- to sync state and UI properly.
- to create consistency in UI.

### NOTE - "react is a library".

#### Framework VS library

    - Framework has strict rules.
    - library does not have strict rules / provides more freedom.

- react creates SPA(single page application).

- react creates SPA because there is only one index.html file in which all the injections and operations are done.


- BAAS - backend as a service.

- react is not good fot SEO purpose.
- react does not have any routing servies.

// **************************************


// L2 *************************************

- refer react documentation (react.dev)

- for web application - react + react-DOM
- for mobile application - react + react-Native.

// create a react project

- npx -> node package executer
- npx create-react-app (don't use this , takes a lot of time to install)

Q) how to read and understand a react project?

ans) 1. always start reading package.json
     2. see name , version , dependencies.

- web vitals check the performance of the application.
- scripts are used to run the project.
- npm run script_name
- start script is used to run the project.
- npm run start / npm start. (like this we can run any script)

- npm run build -> after running this cmd , a build folder will be created which will contain JS extracted from react.

- during production this build folder is given to the client , not the src folder.

// create a project using VITE (USE THIS METHOD)

- npm create vite@latest

- npm i / npm install -> to bring node modules folder.

- npm run dev -> to run vite project.


// ****************************************


// L3 **************************************

- package-lock.json -> this is also a package.json file only , but here a stable version of dependencies are locked.

- manifest.json -> used for mobile devices.

- <noscript> tag -> it prints whatever written inside it when JS is not enabled on the browser.

- react-native is an implementation of react on mobile apps.

- react-DOM is an implementation of react on web Apps.

- react creates it's own DOM known as Virtual DOM . after creating this DOM , it compares this DOM with the actuak Main DOM.

- react-scripts are responsible for injecting Javascript in index.html file.

- App() is a function returning HTML.
- it provides you programming capabilities in HTML.

// for vite 

    - it does not provide react-scripts.
    - hence , JS is injected directly using   traditional method into HTML.

- we can return only one element from react function.
- hence if we want to return multiple elements , we need to wrap all those elements inside a fragment (<></>)

// best practices
    
    - start function names with capital letter.
    - start file name with capital letter.
    - some libraries will force you to keep file extension with .jsx . only for those files which are returning some HTML .
    
    - JSX - JS returning HTML.

    NOTE - any file returning HTML can have .jsx extension.

// creating our own react

// 2:02:22

- react uses a bundler.

- expression , evaluated expression.

- we need to follow the standard syntax that has been predefined , while creating our own react element . we cannot use any random syntax while creating a react element.

steps to create our own react element - 

    1) first we need a container where we will inject our react element.
    2) now we need a customRender method using which we will inject our element.
    3) in this method we will pass the reactElement and the container on which we will inject our reactElement.
    4) NOTE - follow standard syntax while creating the reactElement.

# hooks

while creating projects - 

- main file is "main.jsx"
- do work on "App.jsx"

Counter Project -

- main power of react comes when there is UI updation.
- i.e, a single variable is getting updated at multiple places in UI.
- in such scenario , react controls the UI updation process smoothly.

- for this UI updation purpose , react provides some methods known as "hooks" , which helps in easy/smooth UI updation.

- every hook performs a particular task.

- import { useState } from 'react'  -> importing a hook.

different hooks - 

### useState - 
    - used to change state and update state in UI.

    // using a hook
  ** syntax - let [counter , setCounter] = useState(15) **

    // we can use any name in place of counter and setCounter.
    // counter variable used here will get updated in UI.
    // setCounter is  a method that will control counter variable.
    // 15 -> default value of counter variable. we can use any value here.
    // now whenever you want to update value of counter , just call setCounter method and do the updation inside that.
    // it will automatically update the value of counter at all the places in the UI.

// virtual DOM in react
(not used today)

in react , 
-- createRoot() method creates a DOM like structure behind the scene.
-- this DOM is known as Virtual DOM.
-- then this virtual DOM is compared with browsers main DOM.
-- then instead od re-creating the entire DOM ,  only the required changes are made in the browsers actual DOM.
-- the algorithm used to update DOM by comparing with virtual DOM is "react fiber".

whereas,
-- in browser , everytime a new DOM is created . this is known as page-reloading , i.e, to create a new DOM everytime.

-- read article about react fiber
-- https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture
-- key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

-- reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

-- Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM.

// ********* imp for interview ******************
-- Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."
// ********************************************

The key points are:

-- In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.

-- Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.

-- A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

-- pause work and come back to it later.
-- assign priority to different types of work.
-- reuse previously completed work.
-- abort work if it's no longer needed.
//***************************************************

// L7 ****************************************************
props(properties in react) and tailwind CSS

-- every tag must be  closed tag in react.

-- props make components reusable.

-- we can create components and reuse it as many times as we want.
-- we can also pass values from these components
-- to receive and use these values we will use props inside the function that we created for components.

useCallback() - read more about this hook

 -- useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
 -- The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
 -- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
 -- The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
-- This can improve performance.
